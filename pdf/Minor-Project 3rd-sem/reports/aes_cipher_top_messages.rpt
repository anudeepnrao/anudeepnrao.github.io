  2   Info  GLO-34     Deleting instances not driving any primary         
                       outputs.                                           
                       Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                       redundancy removal could change the connections    
                       so a hierarchical instance does not drive any      
                       primary outputs anymore. To see the list of        
                       deleted hierarchical instances, set the            
                       'information_level' attribute to 2 or above. If    
                       the message is truncated set the message           
                       attribute 'truncate' to false to see the complete  
                       list. To prevent this optimization, set the        
                       'delete_unloaded_insts' root/subdesign attribute   
                       to 'false' or 'preserve' instance attribute to

 24   Info  GLO-40     Combinational hierarchical blocks with identical

                       This optimization usually reduces design area. To  
                       prevent merging of combinational hierarchical      
                       blocks, set the
